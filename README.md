# Overview

This is the third HTML email project I've built, with the previous two consisting of Vanilla HTML/CSS markup and the MJML framework. This is an exploration in the use of Maizzle to get to know another approach in creating responsive compatible emails. The production build has been tested with Gmail, Gmail for Android, Outlook for Windows, and Outlook.com.
